# Basic Stock App

This basic Stock App pulls API data from the AlphaVantage Stock API to give the user the most recent stock information regarding the stock of their choice.

## Tech Used: 
Python 3.13.7
requests library

## Installation:
Clone repo: git clone https:/github.com/ImR10/stock-info.git
Navigate to folder: cd stock-info
Run app: python StockApp.py

## What I learned:
1. How to call APIs with Python
2. JSON formating REST APIs to print data

## Future Improvements:
- [ ] Develop an OOP Project using this API
- [ ] Use these call to start doing calculations to future stock prices
- [ ] Query other function parameters
